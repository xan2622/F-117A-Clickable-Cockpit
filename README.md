# F-117A-Clickable-Cockpit

This Autohotkey (v2) script is meant to be used alongside the game [F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter 2.0](https://store.steampowered.com/app/328920/F117A_Nighthawk_Stealth_Fighter_20/).<br/>
It allows to click on the cockpit buttons with the mouse cursor.

Here are the supported (clickable) buttons: <br/>
Select Weapon, NAV/AIR/GND, HUD de-clutter, ILS, Chaff, Flare, Decoy, ECM, IRJ, MAP/TAC, MFD Zoom in, MFD Zoom out, WAY, WPN, GRD, FLIR, BAY, AUTO, GEAR, FLAPS, BRAKE, Eject, Accelerate, Normal Speed, Pause, Maximum Power, Increase Power, Decrease Power, No Power, ...

It's also possible to use the mouse wheel over the left MFD to zoom in/out.<br/>
For convenience, WASD keys mimic the directionnal arrow keys.

I hope to make this script stable enough and make it work on several computers (several screen resolutions, Windows DPI settings, etc).

The main problem of [DOSBox](https://www.dosbox.com/) is that it "captures" the mouse cursor, making the Windows one invisible in-game.<br/>
This doesn't happen with [DOSBox-X](https://dosbox-x.com/) because it displays the Windows mouse cursor over the (client) game area by default.<br/>
ðŸ‘‰ I found a workaround which makes the mouse cursor visible while playing games (such as F-117A Nighhawk Stealth Fighter 2.0) in DOSBox.
